- conventions best practices

## Fast Cart Shop
!["sideBar Screen"](https://github.com/willianchu/reactLargeScaleConcepts/blob/main/docs/cartsidebar.jpg)

it has multiple different pages. The only page that has any content is the store.
when you add anything to the cart you can go to a different page where you can interact with it or just go back and add more items, working across multiple pages


DEVELOPMENT Notes:
Creation of the store
npm create vite .
npm i react-router-dom bootstrap react-bootstrap

** Basic folder structure:
- components;
- context;
- data;
- hooks;
- pages;
- utilities.

** export function instead of export default function, larger projects will have all exports named that is a little bit easier to keep track of everything.

** Page server side rendering:

index > main > app > components

main - BrowserRouter

app - routes
